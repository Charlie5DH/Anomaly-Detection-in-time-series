## Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data with Keras

Now, we will design and train an LSTM autoencoder using the Keras API with Tensorflow 2 as the backend to detect anomalies (sudden price changes) in the S&P 500 index. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

- Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
- Task 2: Load and Inspect the S&P 500 Index Data
- Task 3: Data Preprocessing
- Task 4: Temporalize Data and Create Training and Test Splits
- Task 5: Build an LSTM Autoencoder
- Task 6: Train the Autoencoder
- Task 7: Plot Metrics and Evaluate the Model
- Task 8: Detect Anomalies in the S&P 500 Index Data
